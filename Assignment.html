      <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      AI is a fascinating field that involves the development of computer
      systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence,
      such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Some examples of
      AI include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and
      image recognition software. There are also various types of AI, including
      narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and
      general or strong AI, which aims to replicate human intelligence.

      <h2>Will AI replace humans</h2>
      The notion that AI will take over the world is a popular topic of debate
      in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and futurism. While AI
      has made tremendous progress in recent years, surpassing human
      capabilities in specific tasks such as chess, Go, and language
      translation, the idea of AI takeover is still largely speculative. Most
      experts agree that AI is unlikely to become sentient or develop a desire
      to dominate humanity.

      <h2>Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        Computer science is the study of the theory, design, and implementation
        of computer systems and applications. It involves the use of algorithms,
        data structures, and software engineering to develop efficient and
        effective solutions to real-world problems. Computer science encompasses
        a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence, machine
        learning, computer networks, databases, and human-computer interaction.
        It is a rapidly evolving field that has significant impacts on various
        aspects of modern life, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and
        education.

      <h2>Programming Language</h2>
      <p>
        A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with
        computers and other machines. It allows developers to write code that
        can be executed by a computer, creating software, apps, and other
        digital products. Popular programming languages include Python, Java,
        JavaScript, C++, and C#. Each language has its own syntax,
        characteristics, and use cases. With over 700 languages in existence,
        programming languages continue to evolve, making it easier for
        developers to create innovative solutions for various industries and
        applications.

      <summary>Java</summary>
      <p>
        ava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by
        Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle Corporation. It was created by
        James Gosling and his team in the mid-1990s. Java is designed to be
        platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device
        that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without the need for
        recompilation.

      <summary>Python</summary>
      <p>
        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design
        philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
        indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.
